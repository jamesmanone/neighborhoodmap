# Neighborhood Map

Neighborhood Map is a single page app showing a few of my favorite places in St.Petersburg, FL. It makes use of third party api's and responsive web design techniques to show these locations and information about them.

## Getting started

Before using Neighborhood map you must install the dependencies. Neighborhood map requires that you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm (included with node). Once node is installed, you can clone this repository. To clone this, navigate to the folder you want this located in from a bash prompt(mac terminal or windows gitbash). From the prompt enter  
`git clone https://github.com/jamesmanone/neighborhoodmap.git`  
then enter  
`npm install`  
This will install the dependencies. You can then type  
`node server.js`  
to start the server. You can then view the project by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
